**tomato** is an instrument automation package, currently developed at the 
`ConCat lab <https://tu.berlin/en/concat/>`_, and previously in the 
`Materials for Energy Conversion <https://www.empa.ch/web/s501>`_ lab at Empa. 

**tomato** includes:

- a daemon for pipeline management and job scheduling, :mod:`tomato.daemon`, using :mod:`zmq` and ``sqlite3``;
- the daemon and pipeline configuration utility, :mod:`tomato.tomato`;
- the job and job queue configuration utility, :mod:`~tomato.ketchup`; 
- a set of device drivers, see the :ref:`driver library`.
