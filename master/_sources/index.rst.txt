**tomato** is an instrument automation package, currently developed in the 
`Materials for Energy Conversion <https://www.empa.ch/web/s501>`_ lab at Empa. 

**tomato** includes:

- the job scheduler and queue, :mod:`tomato.daemon`, using a ``sqlite3`` as a 
  backend for IPC;
- the configuration utility :mod:`~tomato.ketchup`, modelled after PBS / SGE; 
- a set of device drivers, see the :ref:`driver library`.

This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research
and innovation programme under grant agreement No 957189. The project is part of
BATTERY 2030+, the large-scale European research initiative for inventing the
sustainable batteries of the future.
