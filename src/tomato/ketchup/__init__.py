Module of functions to manage the job queue of :mod:`tomato`. Includes job management
functions:

- :func:`submit` to submit a *job* to *queue*
- :func:`status` to query the status of tomato's *queue*, or a *job*
- :func:`cancel` to cancel a queued or kill a running *job*
- :func:`snapshot` to create an up-to-date FAIR data archive of a running *job*
- :func:`search` to find a ``jobid`` of a *job* from ``jobname``
