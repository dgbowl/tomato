Quick start guide
-----------------

First time set-up
`````````````````

.. note::

    This section assumes that **tomato** has been successfully :ref:`installed<installation>`.

To prepare **tomato** for its first execution, you need to supply additional 
information configuring the package. The easiest way to do this is to execute
**tomato** in verbose mode:

.. code-block::
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 3
    
    PS C:\Users\krpe> tomato -vv
    DEBUG:tomato.main:loglevel set to 'DEBUG'
    DEBUG:tomato.setlib.functions:local config folder is 'C:\Users\krpe\AppData\Local\dgbowl\tomato\0.2a1'
    DEBUG:tomato.setlib.functions:local data folder is 'C:\Users\krpe\AppData\Local\dgbowl\tomato\0.2a1'
    DEBUG:tomato.setlib.functions:local log folder is 'C:\Users\krpe\AppData\Local\dgbowl\tomato\0.2a1\Logs'
    WARNING:tomato.setlib.functions:config file not present. Writing defaults to 'C:\Users\krpe\AppData\Local\dgbowl\tomato\0.2a1\settings.toml'
    ...

As you see on ``line 3`` in this verbose output, **tomato** is configured to store its local configuration
data in a user-accessible folder:

  - ``$env:localappdata\dgbowl\tomato\<version>`` on Windows,
  - ``$HOME/.config/<version>`` on Linux.

Within this ``local config folder``, **tomato** expects to find at least the :ref:`setfile` 
(``settings.toml``). 

As you can also see from the log, on Windows the ``local data folder`` is by default also set to the
same path, therefore all of **tomato's** information (*device* settings, *state* and *queue* tables, 
*job* data) will be located in this versioned folder.

.. _setfile:

Settings file
`````````````
The settings file named ``settings.toml`` has to be located in the ``local config folder``. 
The default file generated by the first run of ``tomato -vv`` above looks similar to the below file:

.. code-block:: toml
   :linenos:

    [state]
    type = 'sqlite3'
    path = 'C:\Users\krpe\AppData\Local\dgbowl\tomato\0.1rc11\database.db'

    [queue]
    type = 'sqlite3'
    path = 'C:\Users\krpe\AppData\Local\dgbowl\tomato\0.1rc11\database.db'
    storage = 'C:\Users\krpe\AppData\Local\dgbowl\tomato\0.1rc11\Jobs'

    [devices]
    path = 'C:\Users\krpe\AppData\Local\dgbowl\tomato\0.1rc11\devices.yml'

    [drivers]
    [drivers.biologic]
    dllpath = 'C:\EC-Lab Development Package\EC-Lab Development Package'
    max_connect_attempts = 120
    stops_required = 2

The sections ``[state]`` and ``[queue]`` contain the ``path`` of the database containing the
*state* and *queue* tables, as well as the database ``type``. For ``queue``, the ``storage`` entry
points to the folder where the raw data generated by *jobs* will be stored.

.. note::

    As of ``tomato-0.2a1``, only ``sqlite3`` is supported as a database ``type``.

The ``[devices]`` section within the ``settings.toml`` file points to a ``yaml``-formatted 
:ref:`devfile`, defining the hardware configuration of the devices managed by **tomato**.

Additional, *driver*-specific settings may be provided in the ``[drivers]`` section. For the 
:mod:`~tomato.drivers.biologic` driver, ``dllpath`` is required to point to the folder containing
the BioLogic DLLs, while ``max_connect_attempts`` and ``stops_required`` are optional settings for 
the maximum connection attempts when requesting data from the device (default is 120), and the 
number of stops required to consider a *job* as finished (default is 2), respectively.

.. _devfile:

Devices file
````````````
This ``yaml``-formatted file contains information about each *device*, corresponding to an 
individual piece of hardware managed by **tomato**, as well as information about the 
organisation of such *devices* into addressable chunks, called *pipelines*. The *pipelines*
can be thought of as digital twins of experimental set-ups, and should contain all *devices*
required to carry out a *payload* (see :ref:`payfile`).

**devices** section
*******************

.. code-block:: yaml
   :linenos:

    devices:
      - name: MPG2-8
        address: "192.109.209.8"
        channels: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
        driver: "biologic"
        pollrate: 60
        capabilities: 
          - open_circuit_voltage
          - constant_current
          - constant_voltage
          - sweep_current
          - sweep_voltage
          - loop

In the example ``devices`` section above, we define a single BioLogic MPG2 potentiostat.
Each entry in this section has to define the ``name`` of the instrument, the ``address`` 
and ``channels`` available and used for connecting to the instrument, the ``driver`` with 
which **tomato** will manage this *device*, the ``pollrate`` specifying the polling frequency 
with which the **tomato** daemon queries the worker job for data, and finally a list of the 
``capabilities`` this *device* supports.

.. note::

    The ``pollrate`` here is an internal setting for **tomato** and defaults to 10 s. It
    is the frequency with which the *job* daemon supervising the *device* asks the *driver*
    for new data, **not** the frequency with which the *driver* asks the hardware for data!

**pipelines** section
*********************

.. code-block:: yaml
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 2-6

    pipelines:
      - name: MPG2-7-10
        devices:
          - tag: MPG2
            name: MPG2-7
            channel: 10
      - name: MPG2-8-*
        devices:
          - tag: MPG2
            name: MPG2-8
            channel: each

In the example ``pipelines`` section above, we show two ways of defining *pipelines* in
**tomato**. In the first entry on ``lines 2-6``, we define a *pipeline* by its ``name``, 
and assign a list of *devices* into it, identified within the *pipeline* by their 
``tag``, and matched against the ``devices`` section using the ``name`` and ``channel``.

Alternatively, for multi-channel *devices*, such as the ``MPG2-8`` defined in the example
above, a shorthand for defining a *pipeline* for each ``channel`` is shown in the second
entry. The pipeline ``name`` will be generated by replacing the ``*`` with each ``channel``.

Multiple *devices* can be combined into a single *pipeline* using the above syntax.


.. _payfile:

Payload file
````````````
The *payload* file contains all information required to enter a *job* into the *queue*.
The overall schema of the *payload* is defined in the :mod:`dgbowl_schemas.tomato`
module, and is parsed using :func:`dgbowl_schemas.tomato.to_payload`:

.. autopydantic_model:: dgbowl_schemas.tomato.payload_0_2.Payload
